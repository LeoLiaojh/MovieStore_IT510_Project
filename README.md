# MovieStore_IT510_Project
Edit by Leo, 21 Dec 2017
This is a group project in our software development class. Group members include: Leo, Melody, Karim, and Tsu.

The overall description of this project as following:
  This is a system for selling and buying DVDs and videos of movies. There will be three types of users. First the regular customers, they can access the database of DVDs and videos with different types of search. Second there is a group of users that can post DVDs or/and videos to be sold. These users have access to add movies to the database, so that regular customers can search for these movies. When the customer has finished searching for a DVD and/or a video he/she can communicate a message to the seller in order to buy the product from him. The third class of user is the administrator; this user will be in charge of administrating the database and users. The administrator will be in charge of giving and revoking selling privileges to regular customers so that they are able to add videos and DVDs in the database.
